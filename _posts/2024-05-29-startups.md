One month ago[^fn-1], I attended a speaker event at UC Berkeley about ed-tech startups. 
The host, founder of Clever and Y Combinator partner Tyler Bosmeny, gave a lot of good advice about running companies.
Since I'm currently looking for cool, technology-related topics to write about, I've decided to compile my notes on this subject and publish it as a blog post (or, in my personal lingo, a "VJPost").

Here's what I learned from listening to the CEO speak about ed-tech companies:

## What is Clever and why is it worth knowing about? 
Tyler started off the speaker event by explaining that Clever is an educational technology ("ed-tech") company that provides single sign-on, software setup help, and many other API integrations for schools. 
With a team size of 210 people, Clever is used by over half of K-12 schools in the US. Even more surprising is that of the 100 largest school districts in America, 97 use Clever.
It was funded by Y-Combinator in 2012, and in 2021 it was acquired by Kahoot.

*Fig. 1: Proof that I actually attended the event*

Their most well-known product is the single sign-on platform, which I actually remember using in high school. 


## They charge the end user... nothing
American and Canadian schools [aren't charged anything](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/202393278?language=en_US) for using Clever's platform unless they specifically opt in for some extra add-on features. 
 The company instead generates revenue by asking other ed-tech tools, e.g. Google Docs or Aeries (a tool used to track student grades and attendance) to pay to be integrated into Clever. It's a win-win since schools pay nothing, Clever makes money, and the other apps integrated into Clever get more users.
## High valuation isn't always a good thing
Clever's initial fundraising rounds were very successful. 
Their Series A, for example, raised over [$10 million USD through Sequoia capital](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clever-raises-10-3-million-113000627.html).
Investors were impressed and the team was enthusiastic.
	![List of reasons why Clever started to hit a rough spot](/assets/images/startup2.jpg){: width="560" }
A few years after launching, though, the company ran into a problem: 
because they'd already raised so much money their valuation was "too high to raise again." 
This meant that it was harder to pivot business strategies and try new things. 
The high valuation also created inflated expectations of what the company could and couldn't achieve. 
Combined with the other problems Clever was facing (see above image), this created a challenging time for the company.

Fortunately, Clever managed to survive this rough period, but it goes to show how increasing company valuation is not always a good thing.

One thing I'm curious to learn more about are platforms that deliberately avoid formally raising seed funding but end up being successful anyway, e.g. [Dingboard](https://dingboard.com/).
## The founders had "specific knowledge"
One of the cofounders of Clever had a lot of experience working in school districts. 
As a result, the founders had a clear sense of what kind of product teachers would actually use. 
This also prevented them from creating a product that sounds good on paper but wouldn't actually work.
In other words, Clever's founders had ["specific knowledge"](https://nav.al/specific-knowledge). Coined by entrepreneur and angel investor Naval Ravikant, specific knowledge is a type of intuition that is gained through real-world employment (and/or apprenticeships) and is crucial to launching startups in domain-specific areas like ed-tech.

One other thing: a common mistake the CEO warned about is assuming that because most of us have gone through school as students, we know how to differentiate between good and bad ed-tech ideas.

## Overseas acquisitions = complicated litigation
During the pandemic, Kahoot offered to acquire Clever for $500 million. 
There was just one issue: regulations.
Since Kahoot is a Norweigan company, the US government was not happy that students' (potentially sensitive) educational data was being handed over to other countries.
For a while, the founders were concerned the deal wasn't going to happen.

But then one day, the team randomly got a call from the company lawyer[^fn-2], saying that the acquisition had been OKed.

The litigation surrounding acquisitions/mergers between companies in different companies is very complex and probably worth researching further. 
Another thing I'm curious about is, what kind of regulations exist on ed-tech companies in America, and how do these regulations affect the kinds of ideas that founders are willing to take a risk on? A good starting point for this might be data protection laws.

## A startup can just be connecting existing technologies
Clever's signature product, the single sign-on platform, didn't require a scientific breakthrough to implement - rather, the founders connected together already existing technologies in a straightforward, easy-to-use way.

There are many other examples of successful platforms which boil down to connecting other technologies together in a seamless, well-integrated way. 
Some examples of this include ChatGPT plugins, GPT wrappers (which, despite much negative press, can be profitable) and computer vision integration services (e.g. [Datature](https://www.datature.io/)).
## Downtime bad
In *The Social Network*, there's a scene where Mark Zuckerberg panicks over Facebook's servers going down just briefly.
He berates his cofounder Eduardo for causing the site to go down, saying that even a short window of downtime would irreparably destroy The Facebook's reputation and make it appear "uncool" to customers.

*The Social Network* is a dramatized movie, but I don't think fictional-Zuckerberg was far off when he warned about the dangers of downtime. 
In the case of Clever, going down for just **three days** was enough to cause a mini-disaster for the company, complete with phone calls from upset school administrators and long nights spent debugging technical issues. 
To make matters worse, the downtime happened during standardized testing season.

Luckily, the incident was resolved and from then on, it was referred to as "The Great Three-Day Outage". 
(You can actually see this phrase at the bottom of the image from earlier about how high valuation can hurt startups.)

## Conclusion
The talk only lasted an hour or two, but I felt like a got a lot of out of it. 
Moving forward, I'd like to better understand what makes technology businesses succeed and fail. 
Besides the actual product a company produces, what else determines its success or failure?

[^fn-1]: As for why I'm posting this one month late: When I got home that night from the speaker event I made a solid two pages of notes about all the interesting things he said. I posted about it on [Airchat](https://www.air.chat/) and made a mental note to write a blog post about it later. But then, final exams rolled around and I forgot about the post. Fortunately, a few weeks later stumbled upon my notes about Clever while flipping through my notebook.
[^fn-2]: For those curious about the exact regulatory agencyou  which allowed Kahoot to purchase Clever, it appears to have been the [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)](https://kahoot.com/investor/announcements/kahoots-acquisition-of-clever-update-regarding-expected-time-of-completion/).
