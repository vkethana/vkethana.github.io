One month ago[^fn-1], I attended a speaker event at UC Berkeley about ed-tech startups. 
The host, founder and Y Combinator partner Tyler Bosmeny, gave a lot of good advice about running companies.
Since I'm currently looking for cool, technology-related topics to write about, I've decided to compile my notes on this subject and publish it as a blog post (or, in my personal lingo, a "VJPost").

Here's what I learned from listening to Tyler Bosmeny speak about ed-tech companies:

## What is Clever? 
Tyler started off the speaker event by explaining that Clever is an educational technology ("ed-tech") company which provides single sign-on, software setup help, and many other API integrations for schools. 
With a team size of 210 people, Clever is used by over half of K-12 schools in the US. 
It was funded by Y-Combinator in 2012, and in 2021 it was acquired by Kahoot.

Their most well-known product is the single sign on platform, which I actually remember using in high school.

## They charge the end user... nothing
Schools in American [aren't charged anything](https://support.clever.com/hc/s/articles/202393278?language=en_US) for using Clever's platform. 
Instead, the company generates revenue by asking other ed-tech tools, e.g. Google Docs or Aeries (a tool used to track student grades and attendance) to pay to be integrated into Clever. It's a win-win since schools pay nothing, Clever makes money, and the other apps integrated into Clever get more users.
## High valuation can sometimes hurt you
Clever's initial fundraising rounds were very successful. 
Their series A, for example, raised over [$10 million USD through Sequoia capital](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clever-raises-10-3-million-113000627.html).
Investors were impressed and the team was enthusiastic.
	![List of reasons why Clever started to hit a rough spot](/assets/images/startup2.jpg){: width="560" }
A few years after launching, though, the company ran into a problem: 
because they'd already raised so much money their valuation was "too high to raise again." 
This meant that it was harder to pivot business strategies and try new things. 
The high valuation also created inflated expectations of what the company could and couldn't achieve. 
Combined with the other problems Clever was facing (see above image), this created a challenging time for the company.

Fortunately, Clever managed to survive this rough period, but it goes to show how increasing company valuation is not always a good thing.

One thing I'm curious to learn more about are platforms which deliberately avoid formally raising seed funding but which end up being successful anyway, e.g. [Dingboard](https://dingboard.com/).
## The founders had "specific knowledge"
One of the cofounders of Clever had a lot of experience working in school districts. 
As a result, the founders had a clear sense of what kind of product teachers would actually use. 
This also prevented them from creating a product that sounds good on paper but wouldn't actually work.
In other words, Clever's founders had ["specific knowledge"](https://nav.al/specific-knowledge). Coined by entrepreneur and angel investor Naval Ravikant, specific knowledge is a type of intuition which is gained through real-world employment (and/or apprenticeships) and is crucial to launching startups in domain-specific areas like ed-tech.
## A startup can just be connecting APIs
Clever's signature product, the single sign-on platform, didn't require a scientific breakthrough to implement - rather, the founders identified a problem that teachers were facing (wasted class time due to confusing sign-in practices) and developed a straightforward solution.
There are many other examples of successful applications which boil down to connecting several other platforms together in a seamless, well-integrated way. For example: monetized ChatGPT plugins, computer vision integration services (e.g. [Datature](https://www.datature.io/)).
## Downtime bad

## Overseas acquisitions = complicated litigation
During the pandemic, Kahoot offered to acquire Clever for $500 million. 
There was just one issue: regulations.
Since Kahoot is a Norweigan company, the US government was not happy that students' (potentially sensitive) educational data was being handed over to other countries.
For a while, the founders were concerned the deal wasn't going to happen.

But then one day, the team got a call from the company lawyer[^fn-2], saying that the acquisition had been OKed.

[^fn-1]: As for why I'm posting this one month late: When I got home that night from the speaker event I made a solid two pages of notes about all the interesting things he said. I posted about it on [Airchat](https://www.air.chat/) and made a mental note to write a blog post about it later. But then, final exams rolled around and I forgot about the post. Fortunately, a few weeks later stumbled upon my notes about Clever while flipping through my notebook.
[^fn-2]: For those curious about the exact regulatory agency which allowed Kahoot to purchase Clever, it appears to have been the [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS)](https://kahoot.com/investor/announcements/kahoots-acquisition-of-clever-update-regarding-expected-time-of-completion/).
