# TLDR
This is my second project for CS 180 (Intro to Computer Vision) at UC Berkeley. The project goes over how filters work in image processing and how we can manipulate images in the frequency domain to get interesting effects like edge detection, sharpening, and multiresolution blending.
Here's an example of a blended image I made as part of this project:

# Part 1: Filters and Edges

## Part 1.1: Finite Difference Operator

I implemented a zero-padded 2D convolution operation in NumPy, then compared it with `scipy.signal.convolve2d`.

### Implementation Details
I created two versions:
- **4-loop version**: Explicitly traverses each kernel element for clarity
- **2-loop version**: Uses vectorized operations with `np.dot` for better performance

Both implementations produce identical results though the two-loop version is more efficient. One difference from scipy is boundary handling: my implementation uses zero-padding by default, while `scipy.signal.convolve2d` offers various options (fill, wrap, symm).

### Runtime Comparison
The 2-loop implementation is faster than the 4-loop version due to vectorization. 
However, `scipy.signal.convolve2d` is still much faster, probably because it utilizes advanced techniques like FFT to bring down the runtime from O(n^2) - which is my algorithm's runtime - to O(n log n).

### Code Snippets
Two-loop convolution:
```
def convolve(im, kernel):
    pad_x = kernel.shape[1] // 2
    pad_y = kernel.shape[0] // 2

    padded_im = np.zeros((2 * pad_y + im.shape[0], 2 * pad_x + im.shape[1]))
    padded_im[pad_y : pad_y+im.shape[0], pad_x : pad_x+im.shape[1]] = im

    kernel_flat = kernel.flatten()

    new_image = []
    for i in range(im.shape[0]):
        new_row = []
        for j in range(0,im.shape[1]):
            curr_chunk = padded_im[i : i + kernel.shape[0], j : j + kernel.shape[1]].flatten()
            new_pixel = np.dot(kernel_flat, curr_chunk)
            new_row.append(new_pixel)
        new_image.append(new_row)
    new_image = np.array(new_image)

    assert im.shape == new_image.shape, "Shape mismatch detected!"
    return new_image
```

Four-loop convolution:
```
def convolve_slow(im, kernel):
    pad_x = kernel.shape[1] // 2
    pad_y = kernel.shape[0] // 2

    padded_im = np.zeros((2 * pad_y + im.shape[0], 2 * pad_x + im.shape[1]))
    padded_im[pad_y : pad_y+im.shape[0], pad_x : pad_x+im.shape[1]] = im

    kernel_flat = kernel.flatten()

    new_image = np.zeros_like(im, dtype=float)
    for i in range(im.shape[0]):
        new_row = []
        for j in range(0,im.shape[1]):
            res = 0.0
            for m in range(kernel.shape[0]):
                for n in range(kernel.shape[1]):
                    res += kernel[m, n] * padded_im[i+m, j+n]
            new_image[i, j] = res

    assert im.shape == new_image.shape, "Shape mismatch detected!"
    return new_image
```

### Results: Finite Difference Filters

I applied finite difference operators Dx = `[1, 0, -1]` and Dy = `[1, 0, -1]^T`:

## Part 1.2: Derivative of Gaussian Filter

Using the cameraman image, I computed partial derivatives and edge detection with finite differences.

  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt1/cameraman_edge_image.jpg" width="200"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Partial derivatives, gradient magnitude, and binarized edges (threshold=0.20)</em></p>

The edge image shows significant noise, which is why I had to apply the threshold of 0.20. 
I chose 0.20 because lower values recorded too much noise in areas like the sky, while higher values removed important edge details in areas like the tripod.
A better approach to this problem is to apply Gaussian smoothing first.

## Part 1.3: Derivative of Gaussian (DoG) Filter

### Background Info
To create the Gaussian kernel, I select a value of sigma, by default 2.0, and then compute the `ksize`, which I set as 6 times sigma plus one. 
I then invoke the `cv2.getGaussianKernel` with these two parameters.
In this approach, because ksize is uniquely determined by sigma, I only specify the sigma values when listing the parameters.

### Method 1: Gaussian → Derivative

First blur the image with a Gaussian, then apply finite difference operators:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt1/gauss_cameraman_dx.jpg" width="200"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt1/gauss_cameraman_dy.jpg" width="200"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt1/gauss_gradient_mag.jpg" width="200"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt1/gauss_edge_image.jpg" width="200"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Gaussian blur (sigma=2.0) then derivatives (threshold=0.10) - much cleaner edges!</em></p>

I chose a threshold of 0.10 by trial and error: I found that it reduced noise without removing too much valuable information.

### Method 2: Single DoG Convolution

By the property of convolution associativity, we can combine the Gaussian and derivative filters first, then apply to the image in one pass.
Using the combined DoG filter gives **identical results** to applying the two filters separately.
The Gaussian filter here uses sigma = 2.0 just like in method 1.

**The DoG filters:**

</p>

For example, here's the edge image generated by the combined filter. This produces identical results to Method 1 and demonstrates the associativity property of convolution: (Image ⊗ Gaussian) ⊗ Derivative = Image ⊗ (Gaussian ⊗ Derivative).

# Part 2: Applications

## Part 2.1: Image "Sharpening"

The unsharp mask filter enhances edges by emphasizing high frequencies. The process:

1. Blur the image to get low frequencies
2. Subtract blurred from original to isolate high frequencies  
3. Add scaled high frequencies back: `sharpened = original + α × (original - blurred)`

</p>
<p align="center"><em>α = 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0 (more α = more sharpening, but also artifacts)</em></p>

### Blur → Sharpen Experiment

Can sharpening recover a blurred image?

  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt2/sharpened-blurred-taj.jpg" width="300"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Original sharp vs. blurred then sharpened - some detail lost forever</em></p>

Sharpening helps, but there's no way to fully recover lost information. Blurring is irreversible.

## Part 2.2: Hybrid Images

Hybrid images take advantage of how the human eye perceives frequencies at different distances. 
The technique combines the low-frequency components of one image with the high-frequency components of another. 
Low frequencies capture broad shapes and overall structure, which dominate our perception from far away. 
High frequencies encode fine details and edges, which we perceive up close. 
To create a hybrid image, I apply a Gaussian low-pass filter to extract smooth, large-scale features from the first image, then subtract a Gaussian-blurred version from the second image to obtain only its high-frequency details. 
When these are combined, viewers see different images depending on their distance from the image: the high frequency image is seen from close up and the low frequencies one from far away.

### Example 1: Derek + Nutmeg

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/input/man.jpg" width="250"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/input/cat.jpg" width="250"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt2/hybrid-man-cat.jpg" width="250"/>
</p>

**Frequency Analysis for this example:**

**Filtered Results:**

  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt2/hybrid_low_pass.jpg" width="250"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt2/hybrid_high_pass.jpg" width="250"/>
</p>

For this example, the low-pass Gaussian filter had a sigma value of 15.0 whereas the high-pass Gaussian filter had a sigma value of 6.0.
The images were already aligned well, so I performed no manual alignment.
(As for the ksize, it is determined by the formula `ksize = int(sigma*6.0 + 1)`.)

## Part 2.3: Gaussian and Laplacian Stacks

Gaussian stacks progressively blur images, while Laplacian stacks capture details at each frequency band.

## Part 2.4: Multiresolution Blending

Using Laplacian stacks, we blend images seamlessly across frequency bands.

### Additional Example 2: Irregular Mask + Portal (from Minecraft)

Here I use a circular mask to insert another image inside of the purple portal you see below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/input/nether1.jpg" width="300"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/input/nether2.jpg" width="300"/>
  <img src="/assets/images/frequency/pt2/circular_mask_blend.jpg" width="300"/>
</p>
<p align="center"><em>Circular mask creates a portal effect between dimensions</em></p>

Here's how the circular mask works:

<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 20px 0;">
<pre><code>
def make_circular_mask(h, w, center, radius, feather=20):
    Y, X = np.ogrid[:h, :w]
    dist = np.sqrt((X - center[0])**2 + (Y - center[1])**2)
    mask = np.clip((radius + feather - dist) / feather, 0, 1)

    return mask
</code></pre>
I experimented with different input arguments to generate the mask and eventually I settled on a center of (630, 280) and a radius of 265.
</div>
