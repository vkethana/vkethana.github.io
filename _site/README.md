# vkethana's personal website scripts
My personal website does not use Jekyll, Substack, or Hugo. 
Instead, I have created a kind of "omnibus" script that goes through each .md file in the directory `md/` and converts it to an HTML file.
If you would like to use these scripts for yourself, take a look at `build_website.py`
