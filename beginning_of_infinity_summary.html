	<p>Author Nassim Taleb once said that if a book is good, you should ask ten different people to summarize it and get ten, very different summaries. Inspired by this thought, I am writing out a list of summaries of David Deutsch's <em>The Beginning of Infinity</em> from a variety of angles. The goal is to show just how multidimensional of a text it is, and to interest viewers from a variety of backgrounds to try reading the book.</p>
	<h3>1. Philosophy</h3>
	<p>"The Beginning of Infinity is about the power of good explanations and how they form the backbone of modern science. Good explanations are hard to vary and make risky predictions."</p>
	<h3>2. Physics / Mathematics / Computer Science</h3>
	<p>The goal of the Beginning of Infinity is to show that if you want a deep understanding of proofs, computation, or infinity, it cannot come from just mathematical intuition. You have to build it up from the laws of physics.</p>
	<h3>3. Artificial Intelligence</h3>
	<p>The Beginning of Infinity is really about the nature of intelligence &amp; how it is inextricably tied to creativity, explanations, &amp; knowledge creation. AGI hasn't been achieved yet because there's some deep fact about about creativity that we humans haven't yet grasped.</p>
	<h3>4. Human History</h3>
	<p>The Beginning of Infinity is about the role that creativity and optimism play in society. Memes (ideas) form the backbone of a culture and determine its trajectory. Good explanations have the power to change society for the better &amp; prevent zero-sum thinking.</p>
	<h3>5. Biology</h3>
	<p>(Unfortunately, I know very little about biology! If someone with a background in this area would like to contribute a summary, please let me know on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/v_kethana/status/1763315491828031498">@v_kethana</a>.)</p>
