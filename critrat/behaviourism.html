        <p>It was an honour to host the first ever public dialogue between David Deutsch (@DavidDeutschOxf) and Steven Pinker (@sapinker).  They are longstanding admirers of each other's work.  I view Steve's defence of the Enlightenment as more empirical, whereas David's is built more on first principles.  But beyond their shared rational optimism, what else do they agree – or disagree – about?  Topics we discuss are well captured by the timestamps below.  Links to YouTube, transcript, Apple Podcasts, & Spotify in tweet below.  Enjoy!  Timestamps: (0:00:00) - Introduction (0:03:09) - Is AGI even possible? (0:10:17) - Scientific method will constrain runaway superintelligence (0:11:56) - Does AGI need agency to be creative? (0:28:31) - Will AGIs be sentient?
