        <p>I’d say:   You presently operate within an abstract cathedral/workshop built over years…  With some bricks and arches copied from the centuries-old mega-cathedral/megafactory of our culture. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1748557582506078433#m</p>

        <p>The cultural assumption that this is an offer, not merely a request for information.  All sorts of subtext, like gifts and sharing among friends. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1747194742226522438#m</p>

        <p>An unpublished essay of mine which I eventually transformed into the 'The Evolution of Culture' chapter in 'The Beginning of Infinity'. Some people say it's better than the chapter. Go figure. —https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1732522240367890498#m</p>

        <p>🚨 Published for the first time, David Deutsch’s original 1994 article, The Evolution of Culture, explaining how anti-rational memes sabotage culture, education and the Enlightenment. ✨  https://takingchildrenseriously.com/the-evolution-of-culture/ —https://twitter.com/TCSparents/status/1732517946080334040#m</p>

        <p>Throughout history, cities have enabled world-changing innovations in science, politics, and culture.  Certain cities, at certain times, contributed disproportionately to human progress.  Our latest book, #CentersOfProgress, explores 40 of those places: https://centersofprogress.com/ —https://twitter.com/HumanProgress/status/1734003826053595521#m</p>

        <p>Some threats aren’t caused by progress.  It didn’t mention those, but they’re important. Perhaps decisive.  Existing technologies and cultures are enough to destroy us. Iran w/nukes, say.  And impersonal phenomena like supervolcanoes, gamma ray bursts, and unknown cosmic threats. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1729339273743102307#m</p>

        <p>We know so little about this potential future — about its political and cultural landscape, as well as the technology and theory needed to implement AGI — that predictions of doom are entirely prophetic, in the worst sense. —https://twitter.com/Sam_kuyp/status/1728453854562292094#m</p>

        <p>Yep.  Even in the “post-scarcity” world of Iain Banks’s Culture novels, you wouldn’t have the wealth to assemble planets on a whim.  You’d have to convince people, because it’s costly in energy and effort.  In a truly post-scarcity world, such energy would be in infinite supply. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1727129079332413466#m</p>
