        <p>After a year of using ChatGPT, this is the best prompt sequence that I've found.   It's helped me diagnose a lingering medical issue, brainstorm marketing ideas, problem-solve interpersonal conflicts, and is now helping my friend negotiate a boat purchase.

Chat: [expert type]  Me: What questions would [expert type] want to ask to correctly diagnose this issue? Please ask me those questions one at a time.

        <p>The Book of Knowledge:  100 ideas. 100 illustrations. 100 pages.  All arguments, explanations, and concepts inspired by David Deutsch and Karl Popper.  Simple. Beautiful.
