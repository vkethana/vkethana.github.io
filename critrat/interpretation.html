        <p>Information is meaningless on its own.  DNA provides its interpretation by mapping three-letter nucleotide sequences to amino acids.  Many such mappings are possible, but only one is specified.  Ditto for programs. One has to map specific binary strings to specific operations. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1537962135539503109#m</p>

        <p>Here's a few points that hopefully give an idea where I'm coming from:   Suppose you took whatever the brain is doing and you simulated it on a tape Turing machine .. I have a hard time seeing that being conscious. Why? Because how can information be integrated into a unified field of awareness when it is running in serial? One of the key features of consciousness is the unity of it. Of couse it could be an illusion. Still, the Turing machine seems like a reduco ad absurdum. A similar reducto is the thought experiment where people perform the computations by passing slips of paper (I forget the name of it). Yes functionalists just blow these thought experiments off but I think they raise serious questions.   It's possible the computations must implemented in such a way that they are being done in parallel, not serial, in order for sensory integration and binding to occur properly - ie the spatial and temporal structure of how the computations are performed is important to conscious experience.   I also think there might be something to Searle's idea that computation is observer relative, although I am not fully convinced. But, it seems if you choose different dividing lines as to what counts as a "unit" of computation then you end up with different computations ?? So for instance billard balls may be simulating newton's laws on one level, but then also doing some other computation if looked at differently at a different level (if you interpret a ball being in a certain place as a 1 in a register, for instance). On a related note, see this recent work : https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opphil-2022-0225/html?lang=en  A key question is which is more fundamental, physics or computation? I tend to think physics because all the examples of computation I know of are human inventions. If physics is fundamental, then a simulation of physics is not the same as physics - a simulation of water isn't actually wet , and a simulation of a brain wouldn't actually be conscious. But if computation is fundamental, then it doesn't matter. —https://twitter.com/moreisdifferent/status/1737522708785648002#m</p>
