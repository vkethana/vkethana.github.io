        <p>My thesis titled 'Developments in Unitary Quantum Theory', in which I explain Everett's multiverse, the quantum theory of time, and the possibility of time travel, is now available online.  https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:22cc9ee5-1425-4824-8a3a-242ac9b5f00f —https://twitter.com/Sam_kuyp/status/1747191881212068285#m</p>

        <p>Suppose that - in some branches of the multiverse - you’re freezing to death in the woods.  In most branches where you know how to make fire, you do so and survive.  In most branches where you don’t know how to make fire, you don’t, and freeze to death.  Knowledge matters. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1742336978123706472#m</p>

        <p>The weirdest thing yet discovered by physics is not that the world is 4-dimensional but that its geometry is Lorentzian. That it is curved is prosaic by comparison. So are Entanglement and the multiverse. —https://twitter.com/DavidDeutschOxf/status/1724118714969116807#m</p>
