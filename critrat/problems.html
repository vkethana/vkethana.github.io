        <p>The Popperian power of problems:  When the thinker confronts the problem, he has yet neither power nor knowledge.  The problem is his secret patron, who will invest him with a power and knowledge that only the problem can give. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1753953890628763913#m</p>

        <p>Lol, we *already* live in an open society, where anything can be questioned.  And it was HARD AS FUCK to get.  Centuries-worth of social and legal innovations, each solving a thorny human problem.  It‚Äôs horrifically difficult to make a *toaster* from scratch, much less a society! ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1752229940865417222#m</p>

        <p>Be a non-authoritarian author.  Your words aren't meant to turn the reader into your clone.  What will really happen is: your words will be sucked into the complex machinery of the reader's problems, interests, and background knowledge.  What happens then is entirely open. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1752072299023388986#m</p>

        <p>All the features attributed to the human brain in the video below are false.  They are the features of open-ended knowledge creation.  It‚Äôs not that humans need breathing room to work. It‚Äôs that hard problems can‚Äôt be solved directly and predictably.   https://youtube.com/21P9NWhaY5A?si=7PTxe7Yqud5QOg4a ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1750694389330927985#m</p>

        <p>I find the mind endlessly fascinating.  Its capabilities are unmatched.   Animals, plants, black holes, quasars, and all current algorithms have near-zero power and potential by comparison.  Incidentally, my research is 100% about capability, not consciousness.  Why? Because there are many concrete, fruitful questions to ask and answer about capability.  I don‚Äôt have a clue how to go about understanding the hard problem of consciousness.  I think that mixing questions of capability and questions of consciousness only confuses matters.  They‚Äôre separate problems as far as I can tell. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1677544492868485121#m</p>

        <p>Consider this: which curve is right?  The data can't tell you. *All* the curves fit the data. You need something else.   More data? You'll have the same problem again.  This matters, because they disagree wildly outside the data. Pick the wrong one, get the wrong answer. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1593649847969714176#m</p>

        <p>Neil Peart of Rush captured the sentiment well in the song Dreamline.  ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre only immortal - for a limited time.‚Äù  That said, death from accident and aging is a soluble engineering problem.

        <p>X is problematic. X is the best it‚Äôs ever been.  Both statements can be true, and often are.  But, it‚Äôs common to be ignorant of the past, and merely point out problems without realizing or acknowledging progress. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1738760902395015313#m</p>

        <p>More generally, you don‚Äôt get interesting things purely by seeking novelty.  It‚Äôs trivial to be novel in certain ways. Look, I‚Äôll invent a word: ghleghmite. Zero search results. Also, zero value.  Interesting results are mostly the result of working on interesting problems. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1732661259332436173#m</p>

        <p>Humans have only one advantage over every other animal and algorithm.  Our unlimited ability to solve problems and create knowledge.  Losing that would be a great tragedy.

        <p>My good friend @DKedmey is working on a new language learning tool, but there‚Äôs a problem:  A learner will be able to control objects and their behaviors once they can speak the words for them.

        <p>Notably, the problem in the second case is being morally *wrong*.  Not being ‚Äúmisaligned‚Äù with prior human ideas, which may themselves be wrong in various ways.

        <p>The untangling of necklaces is much like doing research.  1. It‚Äôs way too complicated to just solve directly.  2. You try different leads, and see how far you can get.  3. Any simplification, partition, or partial solution of the problem is fantastically welcome. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1727568641011691552#m</p>

        <p>Goods and services will *always* be scarce compared to their myriad potential uses.  So how should these scarce goods and services be used? Who gets to decide?  Money allows us to solve those problems via mutual consent and voluntary interactions. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/Sam_kuyp/status/1727106254886015103#m</p>
