        <p>The Combos  The striking thing about reality is how big it is. I’m not referring to the 200 billion trillion stars or the two trillion galaxies they make up (or the myriad molecular, atomic, subatomic, and sub-subatomic particles one discovers at ever smaller scales). I’m referring to the far larger set of possible configurations of all that raw material.  Reality presents us with an extraordinary supply of LEGO blocks, but the point isn’t to marvel at the blocks themselves. The point is to build, and the set of things you can build with a LEGO set is stupefying large. Likewise, the objects of the cosmos may seem numerous, but they’re comically outnumbered by the many possible states of your phone. It’s not even close. For a closer comparison, the number of subatomic particles in the known universe (or this branch of the multiverse, anyway) is matched just by the number of possible short text messages you could receive. The universe is about as big as the textverse.  Our language needs an update. 'Astronomical' is supposed to mean big, but astronomical numbers are dwarfed by combinatorial ones, like 2^8,000,000,000 (the number of possible states of a gigabyte of memory - 8 billion bits).  Our perspective needs an update, too. Astronomical numbers make some people feel small, but the set of possible states of your mind is not merely astronomical, but combinatorial. It’s not even close.  The Brain — is wider than the Sky — For — put them side by side — The one the other will contain With ease — and You — beside — - Emily Dickinson  And the set of possible states of civilization is far larger still - and growing. Our reach is expanding across and beyond the Earth, and diving beneath the scale of atoms. As our control grows both broader and finer, we obtain more building blocks and combinatorially more possible opportunities.  So, take a walk on some starry night, and see those distant, twinkling LEGO blocks for what they are: a pile of boring raw ingredients that could be arranged in many more interesting ways. Trillions and trillions of gibberish letters that could be arranged into a gripping, exciting book. By us.   Indeed, the present state of the universe is like one book in a combinatorially large library, and it’s one of the most boring volumes. We’re only controlling half a page for now, but that’s changing. We’re gaining more control of the cosmos, and arranging it as we explore the combos - the universe of possible combinations of cosmic building blocks. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1715470181030617119#m</p>

        <p>I research AGI. Things I've thought and learned about:  1. Computation. What makes some things computable and others not? What are the different models of universal computation?  2. Genes & Evolution. They're a fantastic, fruitful, concrete guide to thinking about information with causal power - knowledge. Dawkins is great.  3. Causal power. What is possible? How do you specify and bring about some things rather than others? (see constructor theory, assembly theory)  4. Error-correction. What does it take to discover errors quickly and efficiently - in individual minds as well as institutions?  5. Knowledge-representations. What is the value of representations? What form do they take? What operations should they make easy?  6. Universality. I think human minds can do anything, but in what sense? What abilities allow that?

        <p>The Nature of Progress  Reality, knowledge, and knowledge-creation  1. Mysteries   What sparked the progress of life, humans, and the Enlightenment? Are there any limits to their progress?  Why are humans the only species to reach the moon?  What does it take to solve hard search problems - to find tiny needles in huge haystacks?  2. Exploiting Reality  What does reality allow? What's possible? What's impossible? Is the set of possibilities finite or infinite?  What systems can take advantage of all reality's possibilities? Which ones are universal? Are humans universal? Are AI's?  3. Knowledge  Out of a vast set of possibilities, knowledge can make specific things happen. How?  There are many patterns in reality. Knowledge can capture such patterns, both large and small. Using models, theories, and more.  4. Knowledge-Creation  Two processes - variation and selection - are essential to all knowledge-creation. Popper generalized Darwin from biology to everything.  New things must be created somehow. Good things must be distinguished from the bad ones somehow (and elevated above them).  These processes happen - in very different ways - in humans, aliens (if they exist), animals, and AI's.  5. Powerful Knowledge-Creation  Some processes of variation are likely to produce improvements. Some are much less likely to do so, and are much slower and less efficient.  Some systems are very fast and accurate in distinguishing good ideas from bad ones.  It is possible to direct variation and selection processes to be very efficient. Biological evolution can't do this, though.  6. Our Future  The future is open. We may face an infinity of opportunity. Today, tomorrow, and a trillion years in the future, we will be at the beginning.  Many things are possible. Almost none of them can happen spontaneously. Knowledge is needed to make them happen, and only people can create that knowledge. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1756603207382372370#m</p>

        <p>Five principles of AGI:  1. Possibilities. Reality allows many things. Some are better than others. Most cannot happen spontaneously.  2. Power. A powerful system can figure out what's good, and make those things happen.  3. Knowledge-creation. What's good? You have to try new things somehow, and distinguish between the good and the bad somehow.  4. Universality.  If you can try things and distinguish things in *any* way, then you can discover and do *anything*.  5. Making things happen. Knowledge makes specific things happen - and not others. It's hard to get 1000 randomly-flipped coins to land on heads. It's easy to do manually. Because of our knowledge. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1752835863929569464#m</p>
