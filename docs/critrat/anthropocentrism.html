    <div class="quote">
        <p>“Most ancient accounts of the reality beyond our everyday experience were not only false, they had a radically different character from modern ones: they were anthropocentric. That is to say, they centred on human beings, and more broadly on people – entities with intentions and human-like thoughts – which included powerful, supernatural people such as spirits and gods.” —David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World</p>
