        <p>“After all, computers play chess mindlessly – by exhaustively searching the consequences of all possible moves – but humans achieve a similar-looking functionality in a completely different way, by creative and enjoyable thought.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“But in any case, understanding is one of the higher functions of the human mind and brain, and a unique one. Many other physical systems, such as animals’ brains, computers and other machines, can assimilate facts and act upon them. But at present we know of nothing that is capable of understanding an explanation – or of wanting one in the first place – other than a human mind.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>
