        <p>I compose with sheet music notation (in @doricoofficial).  Then I create and use tabs to learn the piece on guitar.  (Creating tabs is a creative process, as there are different places to play the same notes, and some are better than others.)  https://carlosd.substack.com/p/musical-variation ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1758016170865651920#m</p>

        <p>‚ÄúIf we ditch biological bodies, we‚Äôre not HUMAN anymore!‚Äù  Call it what you will, but we‚Äôd retain all our capacity for love, creativity, science, and art.  Yes, we‚Äôd have no adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine (the ATCGs of the genetic code), but why does that matter? ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1757710808711151880#m</p>

        <p>Aliens & AGIs are like you or me And by the same means Can learn anything - with glee  You have more to discover Than you often think Your creative thought  Will ignorance shrink  Every little helps And may unlock a door If you want to know a lot Dauntlessly explore! ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1508564554460110857#m</p>

        <p>Currently reading Practicing with Purpose, by David Kish.  Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B076NWJSLT/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?ie=UTF8&qid=&sr=  At first, I didn‚Äôt enjoy learning a piece, then I found it could be creative and fun.   Now, it‚Äôs time to get much more strategic and efficient. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1396118275419947010#m</p>

        <p>Studied engineering. Been around engineers my whole life. Never respected engineering more than after watching the series Industrial Revelations. Have new appreciation for human boldness, creativity, and imagination.

        <p>In 20 hours, you can become *vastly* better at *anything*.  It doesn't take 10,000 hours, and often the biggest improvements come early on.  I like the book's concrete advice. I *really* like the background attitude:   Nothing can resist a creative mind for long! ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1362396899110621189#m</p>

        <p>My rule of thumb: If a human can do it easily and quickly‚Ä¶  They shouldn‚Äôt be doing it at all.  Why? The task is uncreative. Automatic.  *Figuring it out* was creative. Executing it is not.  They ought to be freed to think creatively - which is usually slow and bumbling. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1696681434319139174#m</p>

        <p>There are two competing theories of how to get to AGI:  1. Scale machine learning algorithms  2. Discover the mechanism of creativity (in David Deutsch‚Äôs conception of creativity)  You already pay for ChatGPT. You can fund the latter research by supporting Carlos. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/christiandean_/status/1734901002824724568#m</p>

        <p>There are vast differences between biological evolution, animal learning, machine learning, and human creativity.  But, I think they can all create knowledge. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1731330700064747542#m</p>
