        <p>“The whole [scientific] process resembles biological evolution. A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche.” —David Deutsch, The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes — and Its Implications</p>

        <p>“The most general way of stating the central assertion of the neo-Darwinian theory of evolution is that a population of replicators subject to variation (for instance by imperfect copying) will be taken over by those variants that are better than their rivals at causing themselves to be replicated. This” —David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World</p>
