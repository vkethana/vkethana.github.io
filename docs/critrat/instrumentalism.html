        <p>“This has given rise to a misconception known as ‘Occam’s razor’ (named after the fourteenth-century philosopher William of Occam, but dating back to antiquity), namely that one should always seek the ‘simplest explanation’. One statement of it is ‘Do not multiply assumptions beyond necessity.’ However, there are plenty of very simple explanations that are nevertheless easily variable (such as ‘Demeter did it’). And, while assumptions ‘beyond necessity’ make a theory bad by definition, there have been many mistaken ideas of what is ‘necessary’ in a theory. Instrumentalism, for instance, considers explanation itself unnecessary, and so do many other bad philosophies of science, as I shall discuss in Chapter 12” —David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations that Transform The World</p>

        <p>“Induction The non-existent process of ‘obtaining’ referred to above. Principle of induction The idea that ‘the future will resemble the past’, combined with the misconception that this asserts anything about the future. Realism The idea that the physical world exists in reality, and that knowledge of it can exist too. Relativism The misconception that statements cannot be objectively true or false, but can be judged only relative to some cultural or other arbitrary standard. Instrumentalism The misconception that science cannot describe reality, only predict outcomes of observations. Justificationism The misconception that knowledge can be genuine or reliable only if it is justified by some source or criterion.” —David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World</p>

        <p>“Bad philosophy Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation The explanatory part of a scientific theory, supposedly distinct from its predictive or instrumental part. Copenhagen interpretation Niels Bohr’s combination of instrumentalism, anthropocentrism and studied ambiguity, used to avoid understanding quantum theory as being about reality. Positivism The bad philosophy that everything not ‘derived from observation’ should be eliminated from science. Logical positivism The bad philosophy that statements not verifiable by observation are meaningless.” —David Deutsch, The Beginning of Infinity: Explanations That Transform the World</p>
