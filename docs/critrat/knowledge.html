        <p>“knowledge has the unique ability to take aim at a distant target and utterly transform it while having scarcely any effect on the space between.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“The misconception that knowledge needs authority to be genuine or reliable dates back to antiquity, and it still prevails. To this day, most courses in the philosophy of knowledge teach that knowledge is some form of justified, true belief, where ‘justified’ means designated as true (or at least ‘probable’) by reference to some authoritative source or touchstone of knowledge. Thus ‘how do we know…?’ is transformed into ‘by what authority do we claim…?” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Suppose that the lecturer had repeatedly returned to a certain key idea, and had expressed it with different words and gestures each time. The parrot’s (or ape’s) job would be that much harder than imitating only the first instance; the student’s much easier, because to a human observer each different way of putting the idea would convey additional knowledge.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Since theories can contradict each other, but there are no contradictions in reality, every problem signals that our knowledge must be flawed or inadequate.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“The fact that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge. ‘Problems are soluble.’ – The ‘perspiration’ phase can always be automated. – The knowledge-friendliness of the physical world. – People are universal constructors. – The beginning of the open-ended creation of explanations. – The environments that could create an open-ended stream of knowledge, if suitably primed – i.e. almost all environments. – The fact that new explanations create new problems.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Both the future of civilization and the outcome of a game of Russian roulette are unpredictable, but in different senses and for entirely unrelated reasons. Russian roulette is merely random. Although we cannot predict the outcome, we do know what the possible outcomes are, and the probability of each, provided that the rules of the game are obeyed. The future of civilization is unknowable, because the knowledge that is going to affect it has yet to be created. Hence the possible outcomes are not yet known, let alone their probabilities.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“The Medici were soon promoting the new philosophy of ‘humanism’, which valued knowledge above dogma, and virtues such as intellectual independence, curiosity, good taste and friendship over piety and humility.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“That is to say, every putative physical transformation, to be performed in a given time with given resources or under any other conditions, is either – impossible because it is forbidden by the laws of nature; or – achievable, given the right knowledge.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“This is the cosmic significance of explanatory knowledge – and hence of people, whom I shall henceforward define as entities that can create explanatory knowledge.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“the assumption that progress in a hypothetical rapacious civilization is limited by raw materials rather than by knowledge.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Fallibilism The recognition that there are no authoritative sources of knowledge, nor any reliable means of justifying knowledge as true or probable.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“But failure need not be permanent in a world in which all evils are due to lack of knowledge. We failed at first to notice the non-existence of a force of gravity. Now we understand it. Locating hang-ups is, in the last analysis, easier.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“But merely being present in a mind does not automatically get a meme expressed as behaviour: the meme has to compete for that privilege with other ideas – memes and non-memes, about all sorts of subjects – in the same mind. And merely being expressed as behaviour does not automatically get the meme copied into a recipient along with other memes: it has to compete for the recipients’ attention and acceptance with all sorts of behaviours by other people, and with the recipient’s own ideas. All that is in addition to the analogue of the type of selection that genes face, each meme competing with rival versions of itself across the population, perhaps by containing the knowledge for some useful function.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>“Also, memes can be passed to people other than the holders’ biological descendants. Those factors make meme evolution enormously faster than gene evolution, which partly explains how memes can contain so much knowledge.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“The first people to live at the latitude of Oxford (who were actually from a species related to us, possibly the Neanderthals) could do so only because they brought knowledge with them, about such things as tools, weapons, fire and clothing. That knowledge was transmitted from generation to generation not genetically but culturally.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>“Again, Popper was a key advocate of this rejection. He wrote: The question about the sources of our knowledge…has always been asked in the spirit of: ‘What are the best sources of our knowledge – the most reliable ones, those which will not lead us into error, and those to which we can and must turn, in case of doubt, as the last court of appeal?’ I propose to assume, instead, that no such ideal sources exist – no more than ideal rulers – and that all ‘sources’ are liable to lead us into error at times. And I propose to replace, therefore, the question of the sources of our knowledge by the entirely different question: ‘How can we hope to detect and eliminate error?’ ‘Knowledge without Authority’ (1960)” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“It follows that humans, people and knowledge are not only objectively significant: they are by far the most significant phenomena in nature – the only ones whose behaviour cannot be understood without understanding everything of fundamental importance.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>“The ability to create and use explanatory knowledge gives people a power to transform nature which is ultimately not limited by parochial factors, as all other adaptations are, but only by universal laws. This is the cosmic significance of explanatory knowledge – and hence of people, whom I shall henceforward define as entities that can create explanatory knowledge.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

    <div class="quote">
        <p>“The most important of all limitations on knowledge – creation is that we cannot prophecy: we cannot predict the content of ideas yet to be created, or their effects. This limitation is not only consistent with the unlimited growth of knowledge, it is entailed by it.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>
