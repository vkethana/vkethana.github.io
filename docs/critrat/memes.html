        <p>Well, science and capitalism don’t correct errors by everyone being individually right, sensible, and ethical.  And no system is perfect.   Still, despite socialism, etc. being very popular in some circles, millions of people have in their brains some mighty fine memes, even if they don’t know it. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1726697677692260550#m</p>

        <p>So, our flexible brain states have a tremendous effect on what are near-identical, never changing bodies actually end up doing.  As @DaystarEld says: memes rewire what we find rewarding.  Our ideas also rewire what our arms do. Like when you learn to play guitar. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1726510218794979653#m</p>

        <p>1) Human actions are motivated by emotions we evolved for fitness in ancestral env. They are coded in and felt through our bodies.  Even when memes override genes, they still use emotions to motivate. They just rewiring what we find rewarding or aversive. No emotion = no action. —https://twitter.com/DaystarEld/status/1726438176267305162#m</p>
