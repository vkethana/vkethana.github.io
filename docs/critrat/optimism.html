        <p>“One of the consequences of optimism is that one expects to learn from failure – one’s own and others’.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Blind optimism is a stance towards the future. It consists of proceeding as if one knows that the bad outcomes will not happen. The opposite approach, blind pessimism, often called the precautionary principle, seeks to ward off disaster by avoiding everything not known to be safe. No one seriously advocates either of these two as a universal policy, but their assumptions and their arguments are common, and often creep into people’s planning.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Optimism (in the sense that I have advocated) is the theory that all failures – all evils – are due to insufficient knowledge.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Although, through the vagaries of international politics, Athens became independent and democratic again soon afterwards, and continued for several generations to produce art, literature and philosophy, it was never again host to rapid, open-ended progress. It became unexceptional. Why? I guess that its optimism was gone.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Like every other destruction of optimism, whether in a whole civilisation or in a single individual, these must have been unspeakable catastrophes for those who had dared to expect progress. But we should feel more than sympathy for those people. We should take it personally. For if any of those earlier experiments in optimism had succeeded, our species would be exploring the stars by now, and you and I would be immortal.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Optimism is, in the first instance, a way of explaining failure, not prophesying success. It says that there is no fundamental barrier, no law of nature or supernatural decree, preventing progress. Whenever” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>
