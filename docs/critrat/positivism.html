        <p>“Bad philosophy Philosophy that actively prevents the growth of knowledge. Interpretation The explanatory part of a scientific theory, supposedly distinct from its predictive or instrumental part. Copenhagen interpretation Niels Bohr’s combination of instrumentalism, anthropocentrism and studied ambiguity, used to avoid understanding quantum theory as being about reality. Positivism The bad philosophy that everything not ‘derived from observation’ should be eliminated from science. Logical positivism The bad philosophy that statements not verifiable by observation are meaningless.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>
