        <p>Five principles of AGI:  1. Possibilities. Reality allows many things. Some are better than others. Most cannot happen spontaneously.  2. Power. A powerful system can figure out what's good, and make those things happen.  3. Knowledge-creation. What's good? You have to try new things somehow, and distinguish between the good and the bad somehow.  4. Universality.  If you can try things and distinguish things in *any* way, then you can discover and do *anything*.  5. Making things happen. Knowledge makes specific things happen - and not others. It's hard to get 1000 randomly-flipped coins to land on heads. It's easy to do manually. Because of our knowledge. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1752835863929569464#m</p>

        <p>There‚Äôs more to brains, sure.  But, most of the things that are possible in our universe can only be brought about by powerful minds like those of humans.

        <p>Compared to things like Evernote, has @RoamResearch made a jump to universality?  After all, it can represent *any* network.

        <p>Yeah. Some say one is real because it can refer to some physical quantity, while infinity cannot.  By that logic, 1,000,000 is only real if you live in a universe big enough to have a million things.  If not, then 1,000,000 is FAKE üôÉ ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1752068481691033901#m</p>

        <p>It‚Äôs useful to distinguish between two related questions, both fair, fruitful, and fascinating:  1. What can happen within a brain?  2. What can brains cause to happen?  It‚Äôs the computational universality within the brain that enables it to cause nuclear explosions outside it. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1750980289168355486#m</p>

        <p>Might separate my thoughts into three distinct books:  1. Welcome to Infinity, Kid: a friendly guide to danger and discovery in the cosmos (for people who have recently become alive)  2.

        <p>Read my gentle introduction the surreal numbers on Infinitely More. I'm serializing the chapters of my new book, The Book of Infinity, which I have used as the basis of my new introductory course on infinity at the University of Notre Dame. This course fulfills the general university requirement at ND for the 2nd philosophy course for all students, regardless of major. I've had many STEM majors in this class--it's been a lot of fun. https://www.infinitelymore.xyz/p/surreal-numbers #InfinitelyMore #BookOfInfinity ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/JDHamkins/status/1744195842544640418#m</p>

        <p>Just got paid for a 15-minute call! That‚Äôs a first!  @astupple wanted a fast, clear, interactive explanation of universality and its importance to AGI.

        <p>Hey @DavidDeutschOxf, is the set of Cantgotu environments identical to the set of inexplicable universes?

        <p>does monotheism actually promote the idea that the laws of physics are universal?  universality comes hardly natural for us. a polytheistic cosmology partitions time and space to different gods, with potentially different rules. ‚Äîhttps://twitter.com/poetengineer__/status/1738650972203720971#m</p>
