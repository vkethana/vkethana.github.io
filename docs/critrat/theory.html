        <p>“Thus, although the existence of progress in the biosphere is what the theory of evolution is there to explain, not all evolution constitutes progress, and no (genetic) evolution optimizes progress.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>Even sunrise – that favourite example of inductivists – is not always observed every twenty-four hours: when viewed from orbit it may happen every ninety minutes, or not at all. And that was known from theory long before anyone had ever orbited the Earth.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Scientific theories explain the objects and phenomena of our experience in terms of an underlying reality which we do not experience directly. But the ability of a theory to explain what we experience is not its most valuable attribute. Its most valuable attribute is that it explains the fabric of reality itself.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“To say that prediction is the purpose of a scientific theory is to confuse means with ends. It is like saying that the purpose of a spaceship is to burn fuel. In fact, burning fuel is only one of many things a spaceship has to do to accomplish its real purpose, which is to transport its payload from one point in space to another. Passing experimental tests is only one of many things a theory has to do to achieve the real purpose of science, which is to explain the world.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Solipsism, the theory that only one mind exists and that what appears to be external reality is only a dream taking place in that mind, cannot be logically disproved.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“But then the philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804), who was well aware of the distinction between the absolutely necessary truths of mathematics and the contingent truths of science, nevertheless concluded that Euclid’s theory of geometry was self-evidently true of nature.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“In contrast, the ancient theory that all matter is composed of combinations of the elements earth, air, fire and water was untestable, because it did not include any way of testing for the presence of those components. So it could never be refuted by experiment.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Just as genes often work together in groups to achieve what we might think of as a single adaptation, so there are memeplexes consisting of several ideas which can, alternatively, be thought of as a single more complex idea, such as quantum theory or neo-Darwinism.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“The whole [scientific] process resembles biological evolution. A problem is like an ecological niche, and a theory is like a gene or a species which is being tested for viability in that niche.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>

        <p>“Amending the ‘data’, or rejecting some as erroneous, is a frequent concomitant of scientific discovery, and the crucial ‘data’ cannot even be obtained until theory tells us what to look for and how and why.” —https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/103190.David_Deutsch</p>
