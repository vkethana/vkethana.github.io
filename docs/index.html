<h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
<li>Computer Science BA from UC Berkeley (class of 2027).</li>
<li>Computer Programming Associate's Degree from Gavilan College (concurrent enrollment in high school)</li>
<li>Coursework: Data Structures in C++, Introduction to Java, Introduction to Python, Web Development in HTML/CSS, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Multivariable Calculus, Engineering Programming in MATLAB</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programming Experience (five years): Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, OpenCV), C++, Java, JavaScript, R, HTML, CSS, SPARQL, SQL, MATLAB. Familiar with using the KCF and CSRT algorithms for object tracking, and some experience with CNNs for object detection.</li>
<li>System Administration: Experienced with Debian and Arch-based Linux distributions. Designed and deployed personal website (<a href="https://www.vkethana.com">vkethana.com</a>) by installing Nginx on Debian VPS, and later migrated it to AWS S3. Configured Amazon Route 53 to route web traffic to personal domain.</li>
<li>Tools: Proficient in video editing with Sony Vegas Pro, Vim, Nginx.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Experience</h2>
<h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlQzFKQ6lDvLLq6qpwZd_4Shadr_Uq7i/view">OCR Group, FactGrid Cuneiform Project, UC Berkeley</a> (Fall 2023 - Present)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Develop machine learning model to segment and transcribe Old Assyrian Cuneiform tablets using the YOLOv8 architecture in collaboration with Dr. Adam Anderson. (<a href="https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/FactGrid:Cuneiform_Project">website</a>, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlQzFKQ6lDvLLq6qpwZd_4Shadr_Uq7i/view">poster</a>)</li>
<li>Design pipeline to convert nearly 3,000 raster images of Cuneiform signs into vector images using PIL, Inkscape, and Potrace, and then upload them onto publicly-accessible database using MediaWiki API.</li>
<li>Create OCR Python tool to support development of language models for under-resourced languages written in Cuneiform, especially Old Assyrian. Final OCR tool will be used in annotating, and translating, a collection of 3,954 tablet images.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/vkethana/balloon-tracking-software">STEM Research Internship (Paid), Gavilan College</a> (Summer 2022)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Used OpenCV's Python interface to track fast-moving balloons using a cell phone camera. Used the CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking) algorithm. Collaborated with two teammates under Dr. David Argudo, Ph.D.</li>
<li>Processed dozens of balloon motion videos into CSV location data files. Cleaned datasets using Statsmodels to correct for noise, outliers, and occasionally out-of-frame objects.</li>
<li>Authored comprehensive, ten-page document describing how to conduct classroom physics demonstrations using the balloon tracking software.</li>
<li>Research log can be found <a href="https://www.gavengineering.club/project/4">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leadership Experience</h2>
<h3><a href="https://gilroyhacks.com">Co-Founder, Gilroy Hacks (2021 - 2023)</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Organized the first-ever multi-school, student-led hackathon series in my hometown's history: one hackathon in fall 2022, and another in spring 2023. Spring hackathon offered over $750 in prizes/awards and had 26 attendees.</li>
<li>Secured $1481 grant by convincing sponsors, resolved logistical issues throughout the project, coordinated with judges and backers. Sponsors included Wolfram Language, 1Password, and AoPS (Art of Problem Solving).</li>
<li>Support development of hackathon projects in Python, Next.js, Typescript, and Flask. <a href="https://www.gilroyhacks.com">https://gilroyhacks.com</a></li>
