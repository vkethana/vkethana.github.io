<!-- Main content --><ul>
<li>Duolingo more is useful for studying writing systems than languages.</li>
<li>Memorize full phrases instead of individual words. Words on their own are not very useful because they are dismembered - you have no idea how to use them in context. By memorizing full sentences, you gradually build up intuition for when to use which word.</li>
<li>If the language you're trying to learn has its own writing system, learn it - even if you aren't interested in reading or writing.</li>
<li>Knowing IPA is really worth it, and it only takes one (or two) afternoons!</li>
<li>If you want to practice forming sentences and you don't have a native speaker to consult, you can try using Google Translate as follows. Configure the app to translate from the target language to English. Then, use the voice recognition tool to say sentences in the target language. If Google Translate can understand what you're saying, there is a decent chance native speakers can, too. (Of course, this doesn't guarantee that your sentences will sound natural.)</li>
<li>Comprehensible input really does wonders. Listen to enough content in in your target language -- at the right level of difficulty -- and your brain just... figures it out.</li>
<li>Michel Thomas' audio courses are a great example of good language teaching. He doesn't give you ten words and then ask you to repeat them, chastizing you if you don't pronounce them with the perfect accent. Instead, he gives you a set of words and <em>you</em> have to figure out how to put them together. Skeptical? Try listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/rU56v5z3VZs?feature=shared">half an hour of his French course</a> and see how much you learn.</li>
<li>For languages that don't have a lot of resources, your best bet is documentation written by linguists, amateur or professional. Try to find texts that look like <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OHqWFBpQA4yOoNP1sIEi2QsfUQj1cmOZcD673BLdD1k/edit?pli=1#heading=h.cnjuj8jmii4m">this</a>.</li>
<li>For those learning classical languages, you might find <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20221208220810/https://www.wcdrutgers.net/Latin.htm"><em>Latin by the Dowling Method</em></a> interesting.</li>
<li><a href="https://japaneselevelup.com/blog/">Japanese Level Up</a> is another good blog which talks about the philosophy behind successfully learning a language. </li>
<li>Anki is really awesome.</li>
<li>If you're a college student and you're deciding what language to take, consider picking the one that would be hardest to self-study.</li>
<li>When you are measuring how hard it is to learn a language, it's important to take into account the difficulty of finding learning materials, not just the difficulty of the language itself.</li>
<li>We need more people studying classical languages.</li>
<li>We need more people studying under-resourced languages.</li>
