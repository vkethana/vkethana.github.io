        <p>Thereâ€™s a vast world of computations and theories which are indistinguishable in some ways, and yet vastly different in others.  If a student or AI agrees with an expert in one circumstance like an exam, that doesnâ€™t mean they share the same computations/theories. â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1761173004552204752#m</p>

        <p>What makes something computable or non-computable?  Computable things can be generated with finite specification, steps, and storage.  e.g. 10 lines of code, 100 steps to execute, and 1000 bits of memory.  Non-computable things require infinite specification, steps, or storage. â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1642859812454014978#m</p>

        <p>The ability to compute anything - including simulating anything - is powerful.  But, the ability to *build* anything is even more powerful.  Put differently, the ability to transform information is powerful, but the ability to transform *anything* is even more powerful. â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1746833726154142118#m</p>

        <p>Very interesting interview!  Itâ€™s neat to see the different branches of constructor theory.  Also, the different historical inspirations, like von Neumannâ€™s attempt to generalize Turing machines - to go beyond computations to *any* transformation (e.g. self-replication) â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1745220049399353707#m</p>

        <p>Announcement:  For the next week, DM me as much as you want, about anything.   Some possibilities: epistemology, evolution, computation, optimism, futurism, AGI, longevity, mind-uploading, how to do research, sci-fi, golf, drumming, guitar, writing, teaching, etc.  If you want to learn more about Popper & Deutsch, I'll be as helpful as I can.  Why am I doing this?    To better understand my fellow fans of Popper & Deutsch!  I think I can create something really useful, fun, and exciting soon (and profitable, too) - but I need to know more about your situations!  So, if you DM me, you can expect:  1. My best attempt to answer your questions in a helpful, friendly way.  2. I'll ask questions about you, like what you find most confusing/interesting/exciting about the ideas of Popper & Deutsch.  I hope you'll say hello! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜‡  (And if our schedules line up, I'm happy to talk over Zoom, too!) â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1699137187562831896#m</p>

        <p>Just watched @dela3499's awesome summary of The Beginning of Infinity. My thoughts:  - My favorite idea I got from the video: you need to pass a certain threshold of information in order for complexity to emerge. This "complexity" isn't limited to biological stuff like cells or proteins.  - Favorite quote: "before single-cell life, there were no billion-letter-long sequences of information" (paraphrased). Right after this, he makes a good analogy to computer hard drives - won't spoil it here, buy the video! - I like content that features information theory (I think that's what this is called but not sure), complexity, and/or lightboards. â€”https://twitter.com/v_kethana/status/1741628757390360843#m</p>

        <p>Other topics:  Why are large neural networks even trainable? Seems like they should get stuck.  The shittiness of testing - in schools, in leetcode tech interviews.

        <p>I'm reading Permutation City (1994) from @gregeganSF recommended by @DavidDeutschOxf   So far it's freaking amazing - highly recommend.  Here is a key scene where a Copy (sort of an AGI) living in VR asks itself what is consciousness:  "Human beings were embodied, ultimately, in fields of fundamental particles â€“ incapable, surely, of being anything other than themselves. Copies were embodied in computer memories as vast sets of numbers.   [...]  For time to pass for a Copy, the numbers which defined it had to change from moment to moment. Recomputed over and over again, a Copy was a sequence of snapshots, frames of a movie â€“ or frames of computer animation. But â€¦ when, exactly, did these snapshots give rise to conscious thought?   While they were being computed? Or in the brief interludes when they sat in the computerâ€™s memory, unchanging, doing nothing but representing one static instant of the Copyâ€™s life? [...]   What am I? The data? The process that generates it? The relationships between the numbers? All of the above?" â€”https://twitter.com/ThibaultDiP/status/1740808896334209287#m</p>

        <p>Far from causing a â€˜technological singularityâ€™, it seems progress can be both exponential and imperceptible.  For one thing, many dramatic improvements require zero effort from those who will benefit (like with faster communication, shipping, computers, etc.) â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1219209245217951744#m</p>

        <p>I think oneâ€™s intuitions shift a bit when youâ€™re handed a million pages, and do a trillion years of computation by hand (involving many more pages).  At that point, I think you might be ready to believe some quite significant things happened in that process! â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1738264240757068198#m</p>

        <p>Now, imagine executing such a program, taking into account the Chinese inputs.  One estimate says our brains do a billion billion computations per second.  Doing those operations by hand, at about one per second would take a billion billion times longer than a brain. â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1738264237338693881#m</p>

        <p>The paper includes many responses by other philosophers, and I expect Iâ€™ll agree with some of them.  But, first, I think the intuitive picture radically changes when you appreciate *how much* computation would be involved in the Chinese room. â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1738264233748344919#m</p>

        <p>Neat!   As a display monitor, itâ€™s laughably low-resolution.  But, the cars are programmable!  *That* is striking.   While weâ€™re surrounded by computers, our environment is seldom programmable in this way. â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1737911882852249904#m</p>

        <p>Any computation can be performed by a Turing machine, flipping the bits of an infinite tape, one by one.  And any physical system can be simulated by one, too.  For many cases, this seems implausible. But itâ€™s true.  Reminds me of Richard Dawkinâ€™s classic The Selfish Gene, which is 5% about the core idea and 95% about how it accounts for behaviors like altruism - which it seems incapable of explaining, but nevertheless does successfully explain. â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1737535658225213848#m</p>

        <p>Ironically, the modern computational view of the mind is similar (in some ways) to the primitive idea of a soul.  It says the most important thing about us is the abstract information in our brains - not the physical stuff weâ€™re made of.  (That said, abstract programs still need physical computers in order to actually run.) â€”https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1737521555687493726#m</p>

        <p>Some comments on @DaystarEldâ€™s thread:  1. Our actions depend on lots of information in our heads. Some is best described as factual, some as emotional, others as something else.
