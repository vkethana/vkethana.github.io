        <p>At long last, I present to you: the OLLOS essay.  It's got everything: how it works & how I used it, design and concept iterations, future work for it and the OS, and what I learned about personal interfaces.

        <p>Humans are all the same species. But that’s misleading.   More accurate to say: every person is a novel species.  Different way of life. Different behavior. Different habitat.  You can’t predict bird behavior by studying cows. Or my behavior by studying someone else. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1594417555481018370#m</p>

        <p>People Are Complicated, A Conjecture:   Given how many distinct ideas, interests, and traits a person has...  1. *No* pair of people will find each other compatible in *all* ways.  2. *Every* pair of people will find each other compatible in *some* ways. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1350147978384830467#m</p>

        <p>There are two very distinct threats from intelligent systems:  1. Lion-like threats. Very capable and dangerous in some narrow way, but morally incapable. Without human control, they run amok.  2. Person threats. Morally capable, but morally mistaken. Needs persuading/prison/war. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1728505095040492004#m</p>

        <p>Such a creative use of ML-based video editing!  When it’s easy to separate the person from the background, you can easily combine multiple instance of a person.

        <p>In both the lion and person cases, the question is:  How can we make sure the good ideas win?  If a system is too dumb to discover, recognize, and use good moral ideas, then it needs external control. —https://twitter.com/dela3499/status/1728505102531703000#m</p>
