## Bio

My name is Vijay Kethanaboyina, and I'm a computer science student at UC Berkeley aspiring to work as a software or machine learning engineer. 
I've solved problems in technical areas such as computer vision and Linux system administration. I'm also an avid [reader](reading_log) and language learner.

## Experience

### Undergraduate Researcher for UC Berkeley Sky Computing Lab
*June 2024 - Present*
* Collaborating with UC Berkeley CS PhD students to enhance [R2E](https://r2e.dev), a framework for evaluating code generation capabilities of large language models. Scaling Python code generation benchmarks to include snippets from a wide selection of repositories (end goal: 1000+).
* Developing an LLM-powered agent to automate the cloning, setup, and execution of Python GitHub repositories; detecting and fixing installation errors using GPT-4 powered agentic loop.

### Hackathon Cofounder
*2022-2023*
* Organized [Gilroy Hacks](https://gilroyhacks.com), a multi-school, student-led hackathon series for middle/high schoolers in Gilroy, CA.
* Secured a $1,481 grant by convincing sponsors and resolving logistical issues. Coordinated with judges and backers, including Wolfram Language, 1Password, and AoPS.
* Support development of 7 hackathon projects in Python, Next.js, Typescript, and Flask.

### Research Intern (Paid) at Gavilan College
*June - August 2022*
- Developed Python script with OpenCV to track fast-moving helium balloons using a smartphone camera. Utilized the CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking) and KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filter) algorithms. Collaborated with two teammates under Dr. David Argudo, Ph.D.
- Processed balloon motion videos into CSV location data files. Applied Statsmodels to clean datasets and handle out-of-frame objects. 
- Authored comprehensive, ten-page document describing how to conduct classroom physics demonstrations using the balloon tracking software.
