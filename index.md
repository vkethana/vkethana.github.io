## Bio

My name is Vijay ("VJ") Kethanaboyina, and I'm a computer science student at UC Berkeley aspiring to work as a software or data engineer. 
I've solved problems in technical areas such as computer vision and Linux system administration. I'm also an avid [reader](reading_log) and language learner.

## Experience
### Undergraduate Researcher for UC Berkeley Sky Computing Lab
*June 2024 - Present*
* Collaborating with UC Berkeley CS PhD students to enhance [R2E](https://r2e.dev), a framework for evaluating code generation capabilities of large language models. Scaling Python code generation benchmarks to include snippets from a wide selection of repositories (end goal: 1000+).
* Developing an LLM-powered agent to automate the cloning, setup, and execution of Python GitHub repositories; detecting and fixing installation errors using GPT-4 powered agentic loop.

### Undergraduate Researcher for FactGrid Cuneiform Project, UC Berkeley
*August 2023 - February 2024*
* Developed machine learning model to segment and transcribe Old Assyrian Cuneiform tablets using the YOLOv8 architecture, under the mentorship of Dr. Adam Anderson (link to project poster)
* Designed pipeline to convert nearly 3,000 raster images of Cuneiform signs into vector images using PIL, Inkscape, and Potrace, and then uploaded them onto a publicly-accessible database using MediaWiki API.
* Created OCR model to support development of language models for under-resourced languages written in Cuneiform, especially Old Assyrian. Final product used to annotate dataset of 1,068 tablet images.

### Hackathon Cofounder
*2022-2023*
* Organized Gilroy Hacks, a multi-school, student-led hackathon series for middle/high schoolers in Gilroy, CA.
* Secured a $1,481 grant by convincing sponsors and resolving logistical issues. Coordinated with judges and backers, including Wolfram Language, 1Password, and AoPS.
* Support development of 7 hackathon projects in Python, Next.js, Typescript, and Flask.

## Future Projects
*		Continue with my CS coursework (I plan to take machine learning, convex optimization, probability and random processes, and operating systems next year), with some Sanskrit on the side. 
*		Write more stuff on my blog.
