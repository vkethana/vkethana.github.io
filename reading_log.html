    <h2>Currently Reading/Rereading</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch:</b> I went through the book about a year ago, but looking back, I've barely scratched the surface. My favorite chapter is #17, "Unsustainable." If you like discrete math or or Turing machine / complexity theory stuff, you will definitely enjoy this book.</li>
      <li><b>Dune by Frank Hebert:</b> I like the extensive thought that went into the logistics of harvesting "the spice." It's fleshed out and feels believable. Hebert's worldview is more debatable -- he was skeptical of AI and human progress in general -- but this book is so critical to the history of sci-fi that I am reading it anyway.</li>
      <li><b>Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell:</b> Orwell wrote a lot of stuff besides <em>1984</em> and <em>Animal Farm</em>. Did you know that he was fluent in Burmese?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Past Reads</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Seeking Wisdom, from Darwin to Munger by Peter Bevelin:</b> Charlie Munger accumulated hundreds of "mental models" (Daniel Kahneman would call them "heuristics"). Most of them are simple, but that doesn't mean they are trivial.</li>
      <li><b>What is ChatGPT Doing... and Why Does It Work? by Stephen Wolfram:</b> A great primer for topics like NLP, LLMs, and ChatGPT. The author, Stephen Wolfram, has put the whole book online on <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/">his website</a>.</li>
      <li><b>Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card:</b> Passes itself off as a kids' novel, but has a lot of philosophical depth. Kept my interest from start to finish with the deeper philosophical questions. Is it ethical to preemptively strike against aliens? The author wrote a great sequel, <em>Ender's Shadow</em>, but the series fell off after that.</li>
      <li><b>Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card:</b> This is a great example of a successful sci-fi sequel. It doesn't outdo the original book, it complements it. Orson Scott Card sheds new light onto the characters' motivations and explains random, small details that weren't fleshed out in <em>Ender's Game</em>.</li>
      <li><b>The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu:</b> The premise is that there are a finite amount of resources in the universe, so it is only logical that alien civilizations will pre-emptively attack each other. This is known as the "Dark Forest Theory", and it is wrong. <a href="https://nav.al/resources">Aliens would visit for knowledge, not resources</a>.</li>
      <li><b>Antifragile by Nassim Taleb:</b> Very difficult to summarize. If you ask 10 different people to summarize <em>Antifragile</em>, you will get <a href="https://x.com/nntaleb/status/1735647215421411675?s=20">10 completely different summaries</a>. This is always a good sign, because it proves that a book is multidimensional.</li>
      <li><b>The Bed of Procrustes by Nassim Taleb:</b> A very short read. You could finish it in one afternoon, because it consists entirely of one or two-sentence aphorisms. You could also read them one-at-a-time, finishing the book in a few months.</li>
      <li><b>The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb:</b> Philosophy, epistemology, funny anecdotes from the author's career as a Wall Street trader: Taleb's writing style is highly idiosyncratic, and you will either love it or hate it.</li>
      <li><b>Only the Paranoid Survive by Andrew Grove:</b> Written by a former CEO of Intel, the book talks about "critical inflection points," times when a business encounters crisis and must radically pivot its product or go bust. Critical inflection points aren't bad. If handled properly, they can take a business to new heights. The idea of a "critical inflection point" reminds me a lot of <em>The Black Swan</em>.</li>
      <li><b>Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari:</b> No.</li>
      <li><b>Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt:</b> My favorite book about economics. Very comprehensive: talks about housing policy, subsidies, tariffs...</li>
      <li><b>Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond:</b> I was really convinced by the author's thesis until I read David Deutsch's <em>The Beginning of Infinity</em>. Diamond's explanations are highly reductive. They suggest that human decisions play hardly any role in history and that every important event can be explained away with simple geography.</li>
      <li><b>Striking Thoughts by Bruce Lee:</b> Bruce Lee was a great writer and philosopher, and I'm surprised this book isn't more popular.</li>
      <li><b>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson:</b> Unusual philosophical depth for a business book.</li>
      <li><b>Schott's Original Miscellany:</b> Found this in a random bookshop in London. It reads like a Commonplace book from a few decades ago. We need more books like this.</li>
      <li><b>Surviving the College Admissions Madness by Kevin Robert Martin:</b> The book disguises itself as a college admissions advice book, but it's really a set of memoirs + investigative journalism. A thoughtful, convincing book on why College Applications are not just a waste of time, but also hurtful to society.</li>
      <li><b>The Disovery of France by Graham Robb:</b> A phenomenal history book. As late as the 1800s, most of France's population didn't know French. What we think of as "French" today was actually the dialect of Paris, which was only exported to the rest of the country in recent times.</li>
      <li><b>Ficciones by Jorge Luis Borges</b> </li>
      <li><b>The Story of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang</b> </li>
      <li><b>Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes</b> </li>
      <li><b>The Wisdom of Adam Smith</b> </li>
      <li><b>Don't Sleep, There are Snakes by Daniel Everett</b> </li>
      <li><b>On Writing by Stephen King</b> </li>
      <li><b>How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler</b> </li>
      <li><b>Fashionable Nonsense by Alan Sokal</b> </li>
      <li><b>The Story of English by Robert McCrum</b> </li>

    <h2>Non-books, dense blog posts, websites</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm">Nassim Taleb's Philosophical Notebook:</a></b> Stumbled across this a long time ago, and it's a ton of fun to read. There are ~90 pgs about everything from human nutrition to epistemology. My favorite entries:  #66, "Real Books vs Digital Words" and #71, "Low Carb Philology"</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://thatmaldivesblog.wordpress.com/2022/06/21/reflections-on-hyderabad-2022/">Reflections on Hyderabad - 2022:</a></b> If you have ever traveled to India, you might find this interesting. See the section "English English English."</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://japaneselevelup.com/">Japanese Level Up (JALUP)</a></b> My main takeaway from this website is that language learning is way, way easier now than it was just a few decades ago. If you wanted to learn Japanese in the 1980s, your options were limited. Maybe you'd find some old, unsubtitled VHS movies or a battered dictionary at a yard sale, but without tech like Zoom, Anki (a flashcard app), or YouTube, your options were severely limited. It's no wonder that that generation considered learning a language like Japanese a near-impossible task.</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://scale.com/blog/text-universal-interface">Text is the Universal Interface:</a></b> Reflections on ChatGPT, the Unix philosophy, and the history of software development.</li>
