    <h2>Currently Reading/Rereading</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Dune by Frank Hebert:</b> I like the extensive thought that went into descibing Arrakis' desert landscape and how people survive in it. The logistics of harvesting "the spice" were fleshed out well and feel believable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Past Reads</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Seeking Wisdom, from Darwin to Munger by Peter Bevelin:</b> Charlie Munger accumulated hundreds of "mental models" (Daniel Kahneman would call them "heuristics"). Most of them are simple, but that doesn't mean they are trivial.</li>
      <li><b>Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card:</b> Passes itself off as a kids' novel, but this book has a lot of philosophical depth. Kept my interest from start to finish with the deeper philosophical questions. Is it ethical to preemptively strike against aliens? The author wrote a great sequel, <em>Ender's Shadow</em>, but the series fell off after that.</li>
      <li><b>Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card:</b> This is a great example of a successful sci-fi sequel. It doesn't outdo the original book, it complements it. Card sheds new light onto the characters' motivations and explains random, small details that weren't fleshed out in <em>Ender's Game</em>.</li>
      <li><b>The Three Body Problem by Cixin Liu:</b> The premise is that there are a finite amount of resources in the universe, so it is only logical that alien civilizations will pre-emptively attack each other. This is known as the "Dark Forest Theory", and it is wrong. <a href="https://nav.al/resources">Aliens would visit for knowledge, not resources</a>.</li>
      <li><b>Antifragile by Nassim Taleb:</b> Very difficult to summarize. The author found that if you ask 10 different people to summarize <em>Antifragile</em>, you will get 10 completely different summaries. This is always a good sign, because it proves that a book is multidimensional.</li>
      <li><b>The Bed of Procrustes by Nassim Taleb:</b> A very short read. You could finish it in one afternoon, because it consists entirely of one or two-sentence aphorisms.</li>
      <li><b>Scholia to an Implicit Text by Nicolas Gomez-Davila:</b> Another collection of concise, witty aphorisms. He says more in a single sentence than some authors do in entire books. Kind of hard to find in print, but you can find an online version <a href="https://don-colacho.blogspot.com/">here</a>.</li>
      <li><b>The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb:</b> Philosophy, epistemology, funny anecdotes from the author's career as a Wall Street trader: Taleb's writing style is highly idiosyncratic, and you will either love it or hate it.</li>
      <li><b>Only the Paranoid Survive by Andrew Grove:</b> Written by a former CEO of Intel, the book talks about "critical inflection points," times when a business encounters crisis and must radically pivot its product or go bust. Critical inflection points aren't bad. If handled properly, they can take a business to new heights. The idea of a "critical inflection point" reminds me a lot of <em>The Black Swan</em>.</li>
      <li><b>Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari:</b> No.</li>
      <li><b>Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond:</b> I was really convinced by the author's thesis until I read David Deutsch's <em>The Beginning of Infinity</em>. Diamond is too deterministic, suggesting that human agency plays hardly any role in history and that every important event can be explained with simple geography.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Non-books, dense blog posts</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b><a href="https://fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm">Nassim Taleb's Philosophical Notebook:</a></b> Stumbled across this a long time ago, and it's a ton of fun to read. There are ~90 pgs about everything from human nutrition to epistemology. My favorite entries:  #66, "Real Books vs Digital Words" and #71, "Low Carb Philology"</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://thatmaldivesblog.wordpress.com/2022/06/21/reflections-on-hyderabad-2022/">Reflections on Hyderabad - 2022:</a></b> If you have ever traveled to South India, you will definitely relate to this article. A lot. Especially the section "English English English."</li>
      <li><b><a href="https://japaneselevelup.com/reflections-decade-studying-japanese/">My Decade of Studying Japanese:</a></b> I'm not learning Japanese (not right now at least), but this article stood out to me as a really well-written piece on how to avoid common mistakes when learning a new language.</li>
