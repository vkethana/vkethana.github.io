Currently Reading/Rereading
---------------------------

*   **The Beginning of Infinity by David Deutsch:** I went through the book about a year ago, but looking back, I've barely scratched the surface. My favorite chapter is #17, "Unsustainable." If you like discrete math or or Turing machine / complexity theory stuff, you will definitely enjoy this book.
*   **Hands-on Machine Learning Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow:**: I won't be taking Intro to Machine Learning at my college until Fall 2024 at the earliest, so in the meantime I am self-studying the concepts	with this book. Right now my priority is more understanding the math behind machine learning architectures than it is implementing the models. 

Past Reads
----------

*   **What is ChatGPT Doing... and Why Does It Work? by Stephen Wolfram:** A great primer for topics like NLP, LLMs, and ChatGPT. The author, Stephen Wolfram, has put the whole book online on [his website](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/). 
One interesting takeaway is, a lot of stuff about LLMs was discovered through tinkering and experimentation. 
For example, when writing about why a temperature value of 0.8 works best for language models, he admits, "There’s no “theory” being used here; it’s just a matter of what’s been found to work in practice."
Likewise for why attention blocks "split up" the embedding vector -- "we don’t know any particular reason why [this is] a good idea."

	 There are plenty of other examples throughout history of inventions being discovered before people fully understood why they worked. 
	 For example, the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk well before flight mechanics was the formal, well-understood field that it is today.[^fn-1]
	 Many researchers today are tinkering with LLMs in a way not unlike how the Wright Brothers tinkered with airplanes. That's why we have things like prompt engineering and tweaking (hyper-)parameters to see how the model's performance changes. 
*   **Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card:** Passes itself off as a kids' novel, but has a lot of philosophical depth. Kept my interest from start to finish with the deeper philosophical questions. Is it ethical to preemptively strike against aliens? The author wrote a great sequel to this book titled _Ender's Shadow_.
*   **Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card:** This is a great example of a successful sci-fi sequel. It doesn't outdo the original book, it complements it. Orson Scott Card sheds new light onto the characters' motivations and fleshes out subtle details that went unexplained in _Ender's Game_.
*   **The Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu:** The premise is that there are a finite amount of resources in the universe, so it is only logical that alien civilizations will pre-emptively attack each other. This is known as the "Dark Forest Theory", and it is wrong. [Aliens would visit for knowledge, not resources](https://nav.al/resources).
*   **Antifragile by Nassim Taleb:** Very difficult to summarize. If you ask 10 different people to summarize _Antifragile_, you will get [10 completely different summaries](https://x.com/nntaleb/status/1735647215421411675?s=20). This is always a good sign, because it proves that a book is multidimensional.
*   **The Bed of Procrustes by Nassim Taleb:** A very short read. You could finish it in one afternoon, because it consists entirely of one or two-sentence aphorisms. You could also read them one-at-a-time, finishing the book in a few months.
*   **The Black Swan by Nassim Taleb:** Philosophy, epistemology, funny anecdotes from the author's career as a Wall Street trader: Taleb's writing style is highly idiosyncratic, and you will either love it or hate it.
*   **Only the Paranoid Survive by Andrew Grove:** Written by a former CEO of Intel, the book talks about "critical inflection points," times when a business encounters crisis and must radically pivot its product or go bust. Critical inflection points aren't bad. If handled properly, they can take a business to new heights. The idea of a "critical inflection point" reminds me a lot of _The Black Swan_.
*   **Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari:** No.
*   **Guns, Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond:** I was really convinced by the author's thesis until I read David Deutsch's _The Beginning of Infinity_. Diamond's explanations are highly reductive. They suggest that human decisions play hardly any role in history and that every important event can be explained away with simple geography.
*   **Striking Thoughts by Bruce Lee:** Bruce Lee was a great writer and philosopher, and I'm surprised this book isn't more popular.
*   **The Almanack of Naval Ravikant by Eric Jorgenson:** Unusual philosophical depth for a business book.
*   **Schott's Original Miscellany:** Found this in a random bookshop in London. It reads like a Commonplace book from a few decades ago. 
*   **Surviving the College Admissions Madness by Kevin Robert Martin:** The book disguises itself as a college admissions advice book, but it's really a set of memoirs + investigative journalism. A thoughtful, convincing book on why College Applications are not just a waste of time, but also hurtful to society.
*   **The Discovery of France by Graham Robb:** A phenomenal history book. As late as the 1800s, most of France's population didn't know French. What we think of as "French" today was actually the dialect of Paris, which was only exported to the rest of the country in recent times.
*   **Homage to Catalonia by George Orwell:** Orwell wrote a lot of stuff besides _1984_ and _Animal Farm_. Did you know that he was fluent in Burmese? (Edit: didn't finish the book, but plan to return to it later.)
*   **The Story of English by Robert McCrum**: Books about the history of the English language are really fun to read. 
*   **Don't Sleep, There are Snakes by Daniel Everett**
*   **Ficciones by Jorge Luis Borges**
*   **The Story of Your Life and Others by Ted Chiang**
*   **Good Calories, Bad Calories by Gary Taubes**
*   **The Wisdom of Adam Smith**
*   **On Writing by Stephen King**
*   **How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler**
*   **Fashionable Nonsense by Alan Sokal**

Non-books, dense blog posts, websites
-------------------------------------

*   **[Nassim Taleb's Philosophical Notebook:](https://fooledbyrandomness.com/notebook.htm)** Stumbled across this a long time ago, and it's a ton of fun to read. There are ~90 pgs about everything from human nutrition to epistemology. My favorite entries: #66, "Real Books vs Digital Words" and #71, "Low Carb Philology"
*   **[Reflections on Hyderabad - 2022:](https://thatmaldivesblog.wordpress.com/2022/06/21/reflections-on-hyderabad-2022/)** If you have ever traveled to India, you might find this interesting. See the section "English English English."
*   **[Japanese Level Up (JALUP)](https://japaneselevelup.com/)** My main takeaway from this website is that language learning is way, way easier now than it was just a few decades ago. If you wanted to learn Japanese in the 1980s, your options were limited. Maybe you'd find some old, unsubtitled VHS movies or a battered dictionary at a yard sale, but without tech like Zoom, Anki (a flashcard app), or YouTube, your options were severely limited. It's no wonder that that generation considered learning a language like Japanese a near-impossible task.
*   **[Text is the Universal Interface:](https://scale.com/blog/text-universal-interface)** Reflections on ChatGPT, the Unix philosophy, and the history of software development.
