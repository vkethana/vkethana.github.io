<p>
  Instead of calling my writings "blog posts", I refer to them as VJPosts, a combination of my nickname "VJ" and the word "post." 
  My goal is to make posts that are substantial (at least a few hundred words; preferably >1,000), memorable (the more my writing diverges from my autocomplete suggestions, the better), and funny. 
  Here's the full list of all the VJPosts I've written:
</p>
</div>
<div class="posts">
  <ul>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>

	You can subscribe to an RSS feed of these posts <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
</div>
