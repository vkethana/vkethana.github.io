  Instead of calling my writings "blog posts", I refer to them as VJPosts. Here are some things I've written on this website:
</p>
</div>
<div class="posts">
  <ul>
    {% for post in site.posts %}
        <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
	You can subscribe to an RSS feed of these posts <a href="{{ "/feed.xml" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">here</a>.
</div>
