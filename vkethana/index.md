Project Experience
------------------

### [OCR Group, FactGrid Cuneiform Project, UC Berkeley](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlQzFKQ6lDvLLq6qpwZd_4Shadr_Uq7i/view) (Fall 2023 - Present)

*   Develop machine learning model to segment and transcribe Old Assyrian Cuneiform tablets using the YOLOv8 architecture in collaboration with Dr. Adam Anderson. ([website](https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/FactGrid:Cuneiform_Project), [poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vlQzFKQ6lDvLLq6qpwZd_4Shadr_Uq7i/view))
*   Design pipeline to convert nearly 3,000 raster images of Cuneiform signs into vector images using PIL, Inkscape, and Potrace, and then upload them onto publicly-accessible database using MediaWiki API.
*   Create OCR Python tool to support development of language models for under-resourced languages written in Cuneiform, especially Old Assyrian. Final OCR tool will be used in annotating, and translating, a collection of 3,954 tablet images.

### [STEM Research Internship (Paid), Gavilan College](https://github.com/vkethana/balloon-tracking-software) (Summer 2022)

*   Used OpenCV's Python interface to track fast-moving balloons using a cell phone camera. Used the CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracking) algorithm. Collaborated with two teammates under Dr. David Argudo, Ph.D.
*   Processed dozens of balloon motion videos into CSV location data files. Cleaned datasets using Statsmodels to correct for noise, outliers, and occasionally out-of-frame objects.
*   Authored comprehensive, ten-page document describing how to conduct classroom physics demonstrations using the balloon tracking software.
*   Research log can be found [here](https://www.gavengineering.club/project/4).

Leadership Experience
---------------------

### [Co-Founder, Gilroy Hacks (2021 - 2023)](https://gilroyhacks.com)

*   Organized the first-ever multi-school, student-led hackathon series in my hometown's history: one hackathon in fall 2022, and another in spring 2023. Spring hackathon offered over $750 in prizes/awards and had 26 attendees.
*   Secured $1481 grant by convincing sponsors, resolved logistical issues throughout the project, coordinated with judges and backers. Sponsors included Wolfram Language, 1Password, and AoPS (Art of Problem Solving).
*   Support development of hackathon projects in Python, Next.js, Typescript, and Flask. [https://gilroyhacks.com](https://www.gilroyhacks.com)
